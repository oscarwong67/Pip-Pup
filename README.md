A feed of recommended gifs, videos, and pictures of adorable animals.

Basically, it's a Flutter app that pulls from reddit.com/r/aww, and lets you swipe through for videos, images, and gifs.

## Contributing/Running
Set up Flutter: https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install
Then, to run the program, I typically use the default debug/run config in the VSCode Extension Pack: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter

Good luck!
